This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for time-to-event (survival) predictive modeling using the cox proportional hazard regression model. Future work will include 
models for when the proportional hazard assumption is not met as well as the deployment of a GUI to allow for the seamless creation of moedls and rapid delivering of 
plots/insight. 

The stages of the pipeline are as follows:
 --Data ingestion
 --Feature Selection
 --Model Fitting
 --Model Diagnostics and performance
 --Insight
    -- Get best survival curve (automated)
    -- Get survival curve (user-specified)
    -- Get expected time-to-event (automated)
    -- Get probability of event within specified time (user-specified)
    
The beauty of cox models for time-to-event modeling is their ability to incorporate data on individuals for whom the event has not occurred for yet (censoring). As opposed to 
standard linear regression models that require the event to occur for each individual. Additionally cox models do not rely on any distributional assumptions on the dependent 
variable. Cox models also generate very useful survival tables that return the probability of the event occuring by time for each feature of interest. This type of insight can
be extremely helpful in a variety of use cases. 

As with most machine learning projects, the goal is to generate actionable and interpretable insight from large data sets to help guide decision making. For time-to-event 
modeling, some of the most helpful insight is to understand which combination of variables lead to the shortest time-to-event. Using this we can take the necessary next best
action whether it be to perform some kind of intervention at a population level or something more granular at the invidual level. In the population level case this pipeline will 
return the top 5 variables or combinations of variables from the final model that yield the shortest median time-to-event time and at the invidual level the pipeline will 
calculate their expected time-to-event if they had not yet experienced the event while also adjusting for the time they have currently gone without experiencing the event.
